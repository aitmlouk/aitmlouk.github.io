                                        <p class="text">Research in an academic environment provides a unique opportunity to solve real-life problems and vision the technology of the future. My current research interests are concerned with the development of methods and algorithms for decentralized artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data mining. Computer-generated data is becoming ubiquitous in all real-life applications ranging from business to more serious applications like medical and scientific data visualization. In the past two decades, there have been many advances in the field of machine learning and AI. Despite numerous technological advances in both graphics hardware as well as algorithms, many challenging problems still limit the realism and effectiveness of computer-generated data.<br/></p>

                                        <p class="text">My main research goal is to create tools and algorithms for efficient machine learning and AI with private data. Nowadays, data regulated under GDPR and HIPPA are becoming more and more complex to analyze, and as the Web continues to grow, it is important to understand these huge amounts of data for two reasons, first, to better serve customers. For example, giant companies use the data to suggest products, and movies to their users; Google and similar companies are providing personalized search results, targeted advertising, and many other services. Second, an in-depth understanding of the data allows us to leverage it for a variety of purposes. By preserving data privacy, I am particularly interested in developing new methods and algorithms for knowledge discovery, machine learning, AI applications and present them as a valid element for decision-makers.<br/></p>

                                        <p class="text">While pursuing my Ph.D., I implemented state-of-the-art knowledge discovery techniques, big data, machine learning, and multiple criteria decision analysis to find solutions for problems around us such as road safety. I also proposed methodologies to evaluate association rules issued from the KDD process, which has been used in real-life challenges, for instance, road safety, text mining, and social networks. Consequently, I had proposed many approaches to process and analyze large datasets. Besides, I have a substantial amount of industry experience in data mining-related research and applied machine learning. From my previous experiences and current interests, I see myself doing research in data mining, social science, transportation, and business, with a special focus on data mining, Artificial Intelligence, and machine learning.</p>

                                        <p class="text">In the upcoming years, I would like to explore a broad range of topics both within machine learning and federated learning areas that improve efficiency, quality, and effectiveness of depiction while exploiting fields ranging from computer science to medical and business. My research agenda decomposes into many conceptual problems, which will often require technical innovations along three dimensions: models, algorithms, and experimental evaluation. Indeed, I see myself doing research in federated learning with researchers from computer science and other disciplines such as healthcare and business.

                                                        processing steps in a steel manufacturing chain. The methodology includes intelligent coupling of
                                                        interconnected processing steps by numerical simulation, soft sensors, process data and

                                                        relations, and feedback loops between various processing stations enables prediction for smart

                                                        The main idea is that instead of optimising each subsequent process component’s AI model
                                                        separately, there is a benefit to have a distributed AI model that learns how to share information
                                                        between such local AI models, to optimise the overall goal. We apply this in a chain of processes
                                                        for a certain production output quality. The concept is meant to be used in steel manufacturing
                                                        production lines, but the general case can be applied wherever there is a need for distributed AI
                                                        with interacting and collaborating components that need to share knowledge for a common goal.
                                                        The challenge is to learn what model knowledge to exchange, and how, to reach the common goal.

To achieve this goal, a group for register-based research from different departments of Umeå University are connecting for this project "Privacy-aware Data Federation Infrastructure on Heterogeneous Register Data". The major themes of this project are conducting academic research on data federation techniques and privacy preservation on register data sharing. A data federation infrastructure will be thus constructed for practical usage and research testbed. This white paper presents the project background, technology challenges, overall framework, and implementation solutions</p>

                                        <p class="text">My main teaching areas of interest center around data mining, data science, big data, machine learning, AI, NLP, cloud computing, semantic web, fuzzy logic, business information system, ERPs, and multiple criteria decision analysis. I enjoy teaching because of the opportunity to connect with people and share my love of computer science. Each teaching setting has challenged me to expand my definition of teacher. I have pursued extensive teaching in many universities among them Cadi Ayyad University, Private University of Marrakech, Umeå University, and Uppsala University. For all of these courses, I arrange research and scholarly activities to teach students about web development, data analytics, data science, machine learning, databases, and business information systems. I also assign projects throughout the semester and organize weekly or bimonthly meetings in which we discuss the progress of these activities. These additional responsibilities ensure that being a member of my research team is an educational experience, and help to get students involved in the work we are doing. Student performance on assignments and examinations also provides benchmarks for examining student progress, both within and across semesters.<br/></p>

                                        <p class="text">In the context of online teaching, I have pursued extensive mentoring and supervising students at Openclassrooms. I have mentored more than 300 graduate students in a different area of computer science ranging from web development to artificial intelligence.<br/></p>

                                        <p class="text">My major goal is to teach students how to apply general principles to novel settings, many of my examination questions ask them to apply concepts learned in class to new contexts. In some of my undergraduate classes, however, I found that many students had difficulty with the applied questions. Thus, I now teach students how to generalize their knowledge through in-class activities designed to explicitly model this type of thinking, and I have subsequently observed important improvement in student performance on applied questions. In the future, I would like to continue my relationship with the teaching service office and taking advantage of local resources. I would like to integrate ideas I've learned through recent training and experiences in coordination with student feedback to come up with innovative strategies for teaching computer science and make it easy for the student on both theoretical and industry aspects.</p>

                                        <p class="text">To summarise, my careful observations of the teaching methods and philosophies that I experienced throughout my education provide a valuable collection of effective teaching techniques from which I draw. These various approaches lead me to adhere to a principle of clarity that demands that my lectures, expectations of students, and educational goals for them be as clear as possible in the interest of maximizing their educations. Indeed, I see myself teaching various courses ranging from data structure to AI and business information systems. Following are some topic I taught but not limited to:</p>

                                                        processing steps in a steel manufacturing chain. The methodology includes intelligent coupling of
                                                        interconnected processing steps by numerical simulation, soft sensors, process data and
                                                        distributed machine learning. Integrated numerical modelling that captures the interactions,
                                                        relations, and feedback loops between various processing stations enables prediction for smart

                                                        The main idea is that instead of optimising each subsequent process component’s AI model
                                                        separately, there is a benefit to have a distributed AI model that learns how to share information
                                                        between such local AI models, to optimise the overall goal. We apply this in a chain of processes
                                                        for a certain production output quality. The concept is meant to be used in steel manufacturing
                                                        production lines, but the general case can be applied wherever there is a need for distributed AI
                                                        with interacting and collaborating components that need to share knowledge for a common goal.
                                                        The challenge is to learn what model knowledge to exchange, and how, to reach the common goal.

To achieve this goal, a group for register-based research from different departments of Umeå University are connecting for this project "Privacy-aware Data Federation Infrastructure on Heterogeneous Register Data". The major themes of this project are conducting academic research on data federation techniques and privacy preservation on register data sharing. A data federation infrastructure will be thus constructed for practical usage and research testbed.

                                                    <p class="text">In this project, we are interested in the problem of extracting association rules by
                                                        introducing new algorithms and approaches. In general, an association rule is a
                                                        conditional implication between sets of binary attributes called items. The extraction
                                                        of such rules is composed of two main steps which are the extraction of frequent
                                                        itemsets and the generation of association rules from them. The complexity of each
                                                        of these steps is exponential : the number of frequent itemsets is exponential, and the
                                                        number of association rules extracted can be very high, due to the quality measures
                                                        used. In the literature, the extraction of the association rules is composed into two
                                                        main difficulties, the response time and the memory space.
                                                        To overcome these difficulties, we propose in this thesis three main contributions
                                                        respectively allowing the extraction of relevant association rules, the integration of
                                                        the spatial component into the extraction process, and mining relevant association
                                                        rules from big data. In the first contribution, we propose an extraction approach
                                                        of the relevant association rules based on multicriteria decision analysis. Then, in
                                                        the second contribution, we propose an efficient algorithm for extracting spatial
                                                        predicates from which frequent sets of items and spatial association rules can be generated
                                                        based on the preparation of the spatial context and the fuzzy set theory. We
                                                        also proposed in the third contribution a distributed algorithm for the extraction of
                                                        association rules from Big Data. Using these contributions, we were able to extract
                                                        the relevant association rules and reduce the execution time and the memory space.
                                                        In addition, in order to test concretely the contribution of the proposed solutions,
                                                        we designed and developed a software prototype consisting of three interfaces. The
                                                        first entitled ARM interface, is an interactive web interface dedicated to the extraction
                                                        of association rules. The second interface, entitled MCDA interface, it is an
                                                        interactive web interface dedicated to the evaluation and extraction of relevant association
                                                        rules. For the last one, entitled Time Series Forcasting, it is an interactive
                                                        web interface dedicated to the prediction of road accidents. Moreover, interactive
                                                        and user-friendly interfaces have been developed by using R language and rshiny.
                                                        Finally, the experiments conducted on some databases on road accidents in Morocco
                                                        show the significant feasibility of our contributions.</p>

In general, an association rule is a conditional implication between sets of binary attributes called items. The extraction of such rules is composed of two main steps which are the extraction of frequent itemsets and the generation of association rules from them. The complexity of each of these steps is exponential : the number of frequent itemsets is exponential, and the number of association rules extracted can be very high, due to the quality measures used. In the literature, the extraction of the association rules is composed into two main difficulties, the response time and the memory space. To overcome these difficulties, we propose in this thesis three main contributions respectively allowing the extraction of relevant association rules, the integration of the spatial component into the extraction process, and mining relevant association rules from big data. In the first contribution, we propose an extraction approach of the relevant association rules based on multicriteria decision analysis. Then, in the second contribution, we propose an efficient algorithm for extracting spatial predicates from which frequent sets of items and spatial association rules can be generated based on the preparation of the spatial context and the fuzzy set theory. We also proposed in the third contribution a distributed algorithm for the extraction of association rules from Big Data. Using these contributions, we were able to extract the relevant association rules and reduce the execution time and the memory space. In addition, in order to test concretely the contribution of the proposed solutions, we designed and developed a software prototype consisting of three interfaces. The first entitled ARM interface, is an interactive web interface dedicated to the extraction of association rules. The second interface, entitled MCDA interface, it is an interactive web interface dedicated to the evaluation and extraction of relevant association rules. For the last one, entitled Time Series Forcasting, it is an interactive web interface dedicated to the prediction of road accidents. Moreover, interactive and user-friendly interfaces have been developed by using R language and rshiny. Finally, the experiments conducted on some databases on road accidents in Morocco show the significant feasibility of our contributions.</p>

The appearance of several projects capable of simulating federated learning has led to a corresponding rapid progress on algorithmic aspects of the problem. However, there is still a lack of federated machine learning frameworks that focus on fundamental aspects such as scalability, robustness, security, and performance in a geographically distributed setting. To bridge this gap we have designed and developed the FEDn framework. A main feature of FEDn is to support both cross-device and cross-silo training settings. This makes FEDn a powerful tool for researching a wide range of machine learning applications in a realistic setting.</p>

This paper introduces WINFRA, a comprehensive open-access platform for semantic web data and advanced analytics based on natural language processing (NLP) and data mining techniques (e.g., association rules, clustering, classification based on associations). The system is designed to facilitate federated data analysis, knowledge discovery, information retrieval, and new techniques to deal with semantic web and knowledge graph representation. The processing step integrates data from multiple sources virtually by creating virtual databases. Afterwards, the developed RDF Generator is built to generate RDF files for different data sources, together with SPARQL queries, to support semantic data search and knowledge graph representation. Furthermore, some application cases are provided to demonstrate how it facilitates advanced data analytics over semantic data and showcase our proposed approach toward semantic association rules.</p>

Making these data accessible and useful for end-users is one of the main objectives of chatbots over linked data. Building a chatbot over linked data raises different challenges, including user queries understanding, multiple knowledge base support, and multilingual aspect. To address these challenges, we first design and develop an architecture to provide an interactive user interface. Secondly, we propose a machine learning approach based on intent classification and natural language understanding to understand user intents and generate SPARQL queries. We especially process a new social network dataset (i.e., myPersonality) and add it to the existing knowledge bases to extend the chatbot capabilities by understanding analytical queries. The system can be extended with a new domain on-demand, flexible, multiple knowledge base, multilingual, and allows intuitive creation and execution of different tasks for an extensive range of topics. Furthermore, evaluation and application cases in the chatbot are provided to show how it facilitates interactive semantic data towards different real application scenarios and showcase the proposed approach for a knowledge graph and data-driven chatbot.</p>

These databases need to be processed and analyzed to extract useful information and present it as a valid element for transportation managers for further use, such as road safety, shipping delays, and shipping optimization. The potential of data mining algorithms is largely untapped, this paper shows large-scale techniques such as associations rule analysis, multiple criteria analysis, and time series to improve road safety by identifying hot-spots in advance and giving chance to drivers to avoid the dangers. Indeed, we proposed a framework DM-MCDA based on association rules mining as a preliminary task to extract relationships between variables related to a road accident, and then integrate multiple criteria analysis to help decision-makers to make their choice of the most relevant rules. The developed system is flexible and allows intuitive creation and execution of different algorithms for an extensive range of road traffic topics. DM-MCDA can be expanded with new topics on demand, rendering knowledge extraction more robust and provide meaningful information that could help in developing suitable policies for decision-makers.</p>

But, some performance improvements are frequently needed in terms of routing. Hence, several clustering approaches have been proposed to optimize the network services. These approaches are based on increasing data delivery, reducing data congestion, and dividing the traffic into clusters. However, a stable clustering algorithm is always required in order to ensure the data dissemination in a dense, mobile, or a large‐scale environment. Therefore, in this paper, we have proposed a stable routing protocol based on the fuzzy logic system, which can deliver alert messages with minimum delay and improve the stability of clusters structure by generating only a small number of clusters in the network. In this work, the fuzzy logic system has been used to create the clusters and select a cluster head for each cluster. We have used the network simulator (NS2) to generate the results. As a result, we could reduce the cluster head changes and increase the cluster member lifetime compared with recent approaches.</p>

                                                                        <p>Road accidents have come to be considered a major public health problem worldwide. The aim of many studies is therefore to identify the main factors contributing to the severity of crashes. This paper examines a large-scale data mining technique known as association rule mining, which can predict future accidents in advance and allow drivers to avoid the dangers. However, this technique produces a very large number of decision rules, preventing decision makers from making their own selection of the most relevant rules. In this context, the integration of a multi-criteria decision analysis approach would be particularly useful for decision makers affected by the redundancy of the extracted rules. An analysis of road accidents in the province of Marrakech (Morocco) between 2004 and 2014 shows that the proposed approach serves this purpose; it may provide meaningful information that could help in developing suitable prevention policies to improve road safety.</p>

To deal with this challenge, Apache Spark stand as a powerful large scale distributed computing platform that can be used successfully for machine learning against very large databases. This work employed large-scale machine learning techniques especially Decision Tree with Apache Spark framework for big data analysis to build a model that can predict the factors lead to road accidents based on several input variables related to traffic accidents. Based on this, the predicting model first preprocesses the big accident data and analyze it to create data for a learning system. Empirical results show that the proposed model could provide new information that can assist the decision makers to analyze and improve road safety.</p>

Most of the decision makers encounter a large number of decision rules resulted from association rules mining. Moreover, the volume of datasets brings a new challenge to extract patterns such as the cost of computing and inefficiency to achieve the relevant rules. To overcome these challenges, this paper aims to build a learning model based on FP-growth and Apache Spark framework to process and to extract relevant association rules. We also integrate the multi-criteria decision analysis to prioritize the extracted rules by taking into account the decision makers subjective judgment. We believe that this approach would be a useful model to follow, particularly for decision makers who are suffering from conflicts between extracted rules, and difficulties of building only the most interesting rules. Experimental results on road accidents analysis show that the proposed approach can be efficiently achieved more association rules with a higher accuracy rate and improve the response time of the proposed algorithm. The results make clear that the proposed approach performs well and can provide useful information that could help the decision makers to improve road safety.</p>

Moreover, SG produces much more data stream than the traditional network. In addition to the large volume, the data of the SG are characterized by their diversity. However, securing these data flows is essential. Indeed, a single failure or attack could compromise the safety of the whole electrical network, the malfunction of which could have serious repercussions. Therefore, cryptography as a solution is necessary for SG to become realizable and secure. Being able to classify and to make a good choice of symmetric cryptographic algorithms for security of SG, we proposed to use an approach based on multi-criteria analysis.</p>

We first use association rules techniques to explore the correlations between variables in given data (i.e., database and linked data (LD)), and secondly apply multiple criteria analysis (MCA) to select the most relevant rules according to user preferences. The developed system is flexible and allows intuitive creation and execution of different algorithms for an extensive range of advanced data analysis topics. Furthermore, we demonstrate a case study of association rule mining and ranking on road accident data.</p>

The potential of data federation is largely untapped, this paper presents an interactive data federation system (https://vimeo.com/319473546) by applying large-scale techniques including heterogeneous data federation, natural language processing, association rules and semantic web to perform data retrieval and analytics on social network data. The system first creates a Virtual Database (VDB) to virtually integrate data from multiple data sources. Next, a RDF generator is built to unify data, together with SPARQL queries, to support semantic data search over the processed text data by natural language processing (NLP). Association rule analysis is used to discover the patterns and recognize the most important co-occurrences of variables from multiple data sources. The system demonstrates how it facilitates interactive data analytic towards different application scenarios (e.g., sentiment analysis, privacy-concern analysis, community detection).</p>

To deal with this challenge, Apache Spark stand as a powerful large scale distributed computing platform that can be used successfully for machine learning against very large databases. This work employed large-scale machine learning techniques especially Decision Tree with Apache Spark framework for big data analysis to build a model that can predict the factors lead to road accidents based on several input variables related to traffic accidents. Based on this, the predicting model first preprocesses the big accident data and analyze it to create data for a learning system. Empirical results show that the proposed model could provide new information that can assist the decision makers to analyze and improve road safety</p>

                                                        However, the association rule technique produces a huge amount of decision rules, which
                                                        does not allow the decision makers to make their own selection of the most relevant rules.
                                                        In this context, we believe that the visualization techniques would be particularly useful
                                                        for decision makers who are suffering from the redundancy and quantity of extracted
                                                        rules. An analysis of accidents on highways in the province of Marrakech (Morocco)

                                                        provide meaningful information that can help to develop suitable prevention policies to

In fact, in most cases, the real datasets lead to a very large number of association rules, which does not allow users to make their own selection of the most relevant. The searching of the best from the vast array of extracted rules require the identification and use of good measures or techniques of choice. Partial panoramas of these are presented in numerous publications. In this context, we propose a new approach to selecting relevant categories of association rules based on multi criteria analysis using association rules as actions and measures as criteria.</p>

Nevertheless, this advanced technology is still limited due to many problems such as routing protocols, energy consumption, security and data aggregation. Being able to classify routing protocols, we proposed to use a new approach based on multiple criteria analysis in which we use protocols as actions and directed by decision maker's preferences.</p>

It generally spend two important steps, in the first is the extraction of frequent items, and extracting association rules from this frequent items for the second step. This extraction is a difficult task, costly in terms of response time and memory space as the number of frequent items is exponential to the number of items in database. Many algorithms have been designed to answer these problems. Nevertheless, the high number of algorithms is itself an obstacle to the ability of choice of an expert. In this context we propose an approach to make a good choice of extraction algorithm based on multi-criteria analysis.</p>
